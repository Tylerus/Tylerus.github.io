## Project Euler

I was introduced to Project Euler in 2013, when I was still in high school. It was introduced to me as someone who liked math and coding (at this time it was mainly web design). I think I did maybe 20 or so in high school.
In college, when I had settled on CS, my roommate (a non-CS major, I still have no idea how he knew about PE) and I would do them, sometimes together and sometimes separately. I've done PE continuously since then.

I will abide by the rules of PE and not give out any secrets / share any code, but if there are any insights / helpful things I have learned from working on PE I will put them here. It's a great way to stay sharp on programming basics + some number theory.
