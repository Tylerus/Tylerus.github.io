## The 2025 Listening Tour

For 2025, I have set a goal to listen to 50 albums end-to-end. The goal here is to expose myself to new music, to music that my friends and family find important, and to give me something to write about.


## 1. Bob Dylan - Highway 61 Revisited

## 2. Joni Mitchell - Blue

## 3. Stevie Wonder - Songs in The Key of Life
