## The 2025 Listening Tour

For 2025, I have set a goal to listen to 50 albums end-to-end. The goal here is to expose myself to new music, to music that my friends and family find important, and to give me something to write about. Music is something I find that I have a tough time exploring organically, so I like the goal of it.

You can ask people for songs, and you can ask people for playlists, and both are great. Asking someone for an album, however, is a much more personal request. You're not just giving someone an earworm, you're intentionally giving them an artist's finished work.

## 1. Bob Dylan - Highway 61 Revisited
### Where I listened to this: Minneapolis Public Transit
Jan 4 -
Recommended per Rolling Stone's list of best albums. I recently watched *A Complete Unknown* and lamented not knowing a ton of Dylan. It's -1 when I am hearing this, waiting for the Blue Line train, and I'm standing on a bench trying to keep my hands warm on the train station's electric heaters. Feels good to be back in the Midwest.

Like a Rolling Stone is Great and is I believe my first Dylan song ever from when I was a kid listening to  89.3's *The Current* in my old minivan in high school.

After seeing *A Complete Unknown*, getting to *Highway 61 Revisited* and hearing the slide whistle was like seeing a celebrity.

TBH I winced at the 11 minute runtime of *Desolation Row* but I ended up liking that one quite a bit. I think the only one that grated me a bit was *Ballad of a Thin Man*. I didn't care for Dylan's questions to Mr. Jones.

 I found this to be pretty pleasant but not a knockout. There's plenty more Dylan on this list though, so I will be returning here.
## 2. Joni Mitchell - Blue
### Where I listened to this: Chicago Public Transit
Jan 5 -
My Joni Mitchell knowledge, honestly, only extended as far as 'Big Yellow Taxi', which I only knew from the *Counting Crows* cover. All I knew about Ms. Mitchell was her relationship with James Taylor ahead of this album being released.

I'm in line waiting for Amtrak, and maybe it's just because our train was just canceled, but three songs in and these are getting to me immediately. I feel soft. I found these instantly moving and sad. These are songs you would send to an ex girlfriend if you wanted to start a war.

A fun connection this album helped me make is the line you can draw from Joni Mitchell to Bjork. I googled their names together and discovered and read a bit how Bjork takes a lot of inspiration from Mitchell, and this album makes it seem obvious.

I ended up listening to this one a lot while in Chicago, more than I expected. I really like this one as an album. Favorites include the first two, 'California', and 'A Case of You'. The Christmas one I skipped a few times, maybe because it's early January and I don't really want any more Christmas music.

This album made me very emotional very quickly, and it made me teary on subsequent listens. At the very end of my trip to Chicago I hopped on the Subway going to O'Hare. I listened to this album and by the time I got to *My Old Man* I began to cry. I think that my body had needed a reason to let some things out and it found a vessel to achieve this goal. I found this fitting, I think, as I was on the *Blue line*.


## 3. Stevie Wonder - Songs in The Key of Life
### Where I listened to this: A Greyhound Between Wisconsin and Illinois
Jan 5 - This one is Rolling Stone's #1 Best album of all time. Of the three albums so far, this is the one of which I recognize the most songs - Sir Duke, Isn't She Lovely, I Wish.

There's so much going on here, Stevie Wonder jumps around a lot between ideas. A lot more focus on civil rights than I knew about. But it all molds together pretty well. Wonder has a really great voice, and this is definitely the album with the most going on musically so far.

## 4. Alvvways - Blue Rev
### Where I listened to this: At work
Jan 10 - Recommended by my friend Aaron, my first recommendation from a friend. Speaking on *Blue Rev*, Aaron writes: *I love it so much. It has such a strong melancholic yearning vibe. Very morose and learning to move past heartbreak and finding yourself after a difficult time.* (Aaron has a Medium page you can check out [here](https://medium.com/@amv1352))

Molly Rankin & Alvvays don't introduce themselves at the beginning of their album - they plow fast into *Pharmacist*. It's short, tight. I like her vocals. A little *Mazzy Star* in some places.
*After the Earthquake* is very Johnny Marr, and I mean that with lots of love coming from my days as an angsty 15 year old. The album later follows up with *Pressed*, which is even moreso like the Smiths. Some of these songs could be on *The Queen is Dead*. This doesn't last, however; by the time you get to *Tile By Tile* you are in a completely different world.

The second half of the album mostly maintains the energy as the first half, with a few breaks for air. I think I'll end up enjoying the first half of the album more; I think I'm just both an adrenaline junkie and a fan of the guitars.

This album is considered [Shoegaze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoegaze), a genre I had never heard of before. As a guest to the genre, I found it quite nice. As mentioned, my adulation for the Smiths makes me suceptible to guitars with distortion. I'm not sure if it's an element of the genre, or just that this is the first album I have listened to sofar that came out after the year 1985, but the sound is very tightly-wound and put-together, it doesn't let you lose focus on it.

I quite like *Blue Rev* as an album. I think on the marks of giving me something that behaves as an album, Aaron succeeded. It's early since listening, but I think right now I would struggle to listen to any of these songs not in order. That will probably fade. We'll see if *Blue Rev* has staying power in my rotation, but it certainly succeeds as an album.
The big winner of this album? Me! I picked at a few of *Alvvways*'s other songs and I'm stealing them. I like *Archie Marry Me* and *Dreams Tonite*. Maybe I'll listen to those albums in full later on, but until then, we've a backlog to empty!
## 5. Fleetwood Mac - Rumours
### Where I listened to this: At work
Jan 9 - My friend KC told me all about *Daisy Jones & the Six* which piqued my interest in this album, as I really like the idea of exploring albums that are snapshots of stories or the lives of people. I don't know how close *Daisy Jones* is to *Rumours*, but I love a mess.

*Dreams* of course got recent acclaim for that juice-drinking skateboard guy. It's definitely the one I've heard the most on this list.

A woman I was seeing once put *Never going back again* on after we left a party. It's nice, I didn't expect it right after *Dreams*.

I was racking my head about how I knew *Don't stop* - was it featured in some cheesy movie or something? Wikipedia suggests I know it from Bill Clinton's DNC speeches, and *WhatSong* says it's been on the Simpsons twice. Probably a mix of those two. Apparently Bill Clinton is a big Fleetwood Mac fan - hell yeah dude.

Of the albums, this one I think one is the first one where I know most of the songs. The challenge of me then is to fit them within the greater context of the album. Like, I know *The Chain* and *Go Your Own Way*, but do I understand why one goes before the other?

I think this is the first one I felt like I didn't have a lot of energy for. Stevie Nicks is great and the music is fine. But not a lot of enthusiasm to explore it. I have a bit of a fixed mindset with this one. hm.

## 6. Prince - Purple Rain
### Where I listened to this: On the bus from Bellevue to Seattle
Jan 9 - Prince! The man from Minnesota. I love the way Minnesota loves Prince. My experience with Prince is shaped a lot by parents and teachers, who pretty much universally revered him growing up. Unlike Dylan, Prince owned the 'being from Minnesota' label a lot more, and I think people really aprpeciate that. But also, he just makes a lot of really good music. I like a lot of Prince songs, I liked listening to *The Current's* 'Purple Current' Playlist when he died. But it's time to give him the album treatment.

OK, so you know how I knew a lot of songs on *Rumours* and it seemed to drag on my listening? All the songs on *Purple Rain* that I know only add to the fun. I'm having a lot of fun with this.

I don't know if it's the Violin or Cello that's doing the thing in *Take Me With You* but it's Taking Me With It.

An Ex who took a University of Minnesota class once informed me that *When Doves Cry* is special because it is the rare funk song that doesn't have a baseline. It's a [pretty fascinating exclusion](https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/the-lost-bass-line-of-prince-hit-when-doves-cry/) (including a Stevie Nicks cameo!).

As a writer, it's important for me to acknowledge my personal biases in these albums. So it's critical to acknowledge that I grew up with people talling me that Prince is great. But, I really think that Prince is really really great. I love how a lot of songs are split into different pieces. I love the synthesizers and the strings, I love that they feel kind of dated. I love how every chorus is distinctly different just by how he sings.

## 7. Bob Dylan - Blood On The tracks
### Where I listened to this: at work
Jan 17 - This one I also get to claim Minnesota valor - this album was recorded in Minneapolis! Minnesotans sometimes do cartwheels to claim Dylan's origins are from Minnesota - I do this too - so it's nice to have a notch on the bedpost that counts. Famously, my old undergraduate neighborhood Dinkytown has a mural titled ['Positively 4th street'](https://mndaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/052917stneighbors1.jpg) on its 4th street intersection. It's almost certainly about a [street in New York](https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/the-story-behind-bob-dylan-positively-4th-street/), but it's a nice mural nonetheless.

Dylan has less P&V than he does in *Highway 61*.

Reading about this album, sources point to it being a breakup album, and the songs feel that way too. Dylan seems sad! They don't make me sad, though. A good listen, to be sure. I liked *You're gonna make me lonesome when you go* and *if you see her, say hello*. I jumped at the idea of listening to *Lily, Rosemary, and the Jack of Hearts* when it came up randomly on my Spotify a few days ago. I think I am slowly, slowly becoming a Dylanhead, but this takes discipline and time.

## 8 Nas - Magic

Jan 21 - the tour's first entrance into Hip-Hop! Thanks Caitlin. Growing up in the Midwest I was uniquely confused about the differences between East Coast and West Coast Hip-Hop. Does that distinciton matter for modern albums? Not sure. Notable to me is that growing up I was mostly exposed to West Coast Hip Hop, thanks to *Grand Theft Auto* and a teenage enjoyment of *N.W.A.* (When I was fifteen I *swore* I got into it before the movie *Straight Outta Compton* came out and I was *not* a bandwagoner - who's to say, really?). A few years ago, when driving through the East Coast, an East Coast Hip-Hop advocate introduced me to some Biggie Smalls, playing *Parties and Bullshit* and a few others, which I enjoyed. I also like *A Tribe Called Quest*, which embarassingly I know only from their prominence on subreddits like *r/listenToThis* from the early 2010's.I shudder to think how much of my taste was formed from Reddit back then - it's in my Dylan

All this to say, I don't have a lot of thoughts on Nas before coming into this, good or bad. What's tough is, after a month or so, and after a few listens, I still don't have a ton of thoughts. This one is unobjectionalble to me, but not quite a standout.

## 9. Aretha Franklin - I Never Loved a Man The Way I Love You
### Where I listened to this: Mexico City Streets
Feb 16 - If you haven't listened to 'Repsect' in a while, you should, preferrably as soon as possible. This song is still prevelent in the American lexicon but if you last heard it in a Pep Band show or a car commercial or something, give it a two-minute listen. It's incredible. It captures your attention immediately, commands the airwaves, and doesn't waste a moment of time before leaving just two minutes later. It's fun, it's feminist, it's kind of funny (I just love the backing vocals that repeat sockittome sockittome sockittome sockittome...).I'm not really saying anything new here, but you should still go listen to it.

## 10 The Velvet Underground - Andy Warhol
### Where I listened to this: Mexico City

Oh, I didn't really enjoy this one. I think I "get it", like I can piece its influence and I think there are some neat elements to it. But I wasn't particularly enthralled with this one. I liked Nico's vocals, and I love Lou Reed. But I found this one uninteresting.

## 10. Djo - The Crux
## Where I listened to this: Around Seattle, and then on vinyl, and then in concert

TODO

## Oingo Boingo - Dead Mans party
### Where I litened to this: At work

May 15 - Caitlin's second entry on the board.
When I was first getting 'into' music, I was heavily influenced by what my parents were listening to, and they were actively being influenced by the advent of Siriux XM radio making its way onto their new Ford Fusion. For my mom, this reinvigorated a bunch of eighties music that she had long forgotten, and my mother, having a knack for names or bands and artists, was eager to drive and hear songs she could recongize from thirty years earlier. Among these was Oingo Boingo's "Weird Science". I remember this so well likely because of the silly name (I also think of 'Puttin on the Ritz by the band Taco), and I remmeber the song sticking out to me so much I paid for it on iTunes - it was probably song number eight or nine on my iPod.

I had always treated Oingo Boingo as a one-note band from a phase of 80s music from my early teens, and hadn't given them a second thought. I was intruiged to see Caitlin list them.

My biggest takeaway after two listens is this: I think we have forgotten how to make music like this. I feel like you really can't commercialize and distrubute an album that has so many six minute songs with so much musical activity and such an outlandish tone. I don't know if it's impossible, but the launch window would be so slim.

I don't know how to grade this, but as far as earworms go, this one is quite strong. I have OB's "Just another day-y-y" from the opening track in my head incessently.



## Nick Drake - Pink Moon
### Where I listened to this - At home on vinyl

This is a personal one I am taking for a spin, becaue I quite like a lot of Nick Drake and am getting nervous about hitting my 50 quota. It still counts! I don't think I've listened to this all the way through before.
