## The 2025 Listening Tour

For 2025, I have set a goal to listen to 50 albums end-to-end. The goal here is to expose myself to new music, to music that my friends and family find important, and to give me something to write about.

It's -1 when I am hearing this, waiting for the Blue Line train, and I'm standing on a bench trying to keep my hands warm on the train station's electric heaters.

## 3. Stevie Wonder - Songs in The Key of Life
### Where I listened to this: A Greyhound Between Wisconsin and Illinois
Jan 5
