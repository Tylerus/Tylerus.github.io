## The 2025 Listening Tour

For 2025, I have set a goal to listen to 50 albums end-to-end. The goal here is to expose myself to new music, to music that my friends and family find important, and to give me something to write about. Music is something I find that I have a tough time exploring organically, so I like the goal of it.

## 1. Bob Dylan - Highway 61 Revisited
### Where I listened to this: Minneapolis Public Transit
Jan 4 -
Recommended per Rolling Stone's list of best albums. I recently watched *A Complete Unknown* and lamented not knowing a ton of Dylan. It's -1 when I am hearing this, waiting for the Blue Line train, and I'm standing on a bench trying to keep my hands warm on the train station's electric heaters. Feels good to be back in the Midwest.

Like a Rolling Stone is Great and is I believe my first Dylan song ever from when I was a kid listening to  89.3's *The Current* in my old minivan in high school.

After seeing *A Complete Unknown*, getting to *Highway 61 Revisited* and hearing the slide whistle was like seeing a celebrity.

TBH I winced at the 11 minute runtime of *Desolation Row* but I ended up liking that one quite a bit. I think the only one that grated me a bit was *Ballad of a Thin Man*. I didn't care for Dylan's questions to Mr. Jones.

 I found this to be pretty pleasant but not a knockout. There's plenty more Dylan on this list though, so I will be returning here.
## 2. Joni Mitchell - Blue
### Where I listened to this: Chicago Public Transit
Jan 5 -
My Joni Mitchell knowledge, honestly, only extended as far as 'Big Yellow Taxi', which I only knew from the *Counting Crows* cover. All I knew about Ms. Mitchell was her relationship with James Taylor ahead of this album being released.

I'm in line waiting for Amtrak, and maybe it's just because our train was just canceled, but three songs in and these are getting to me immediately. I feel soft. I found these instantly moving and sad. These are songs you would send to an ex girlfriend if you wanted to start a war.

A fun connection this album helped me make is the line you can draw from Joni Mitchell to Bjork. I googled their names together and discovered and read a bit how Bjork takes a lot of inspiration from Mitchell, and this album makes it seem obvious.

I ended up listening to this one a lot while in Chicago, more than I expected. I really like this one as an album. Favorites include the first two, 'California', and 'A Case of You'. The Christmas one I skipped a few times, maybe because it's early January and I don't really want any more Christmas music.

This album made me very emotional very quickly!

## 3. Stevie Wonder - Songs in The Key of Life
### Where I listened to this: A Greyhound Between Wisconsin and Illinois
Jan 5 - This one is Rolling Stone's #1 Best album of all time. Of the three albums so far, this is the one of which I recognize the most songs - Sir Duke, Isn't She Lovely, I Wish.

There's so much going on here, Stevie Wonder jumps around a lot between ideas. A lot more focus on civil rights than I knew about. But it all molds together pretty well. Wonder has a really great voice, and this is definitely the album with the most going on musically so far.
