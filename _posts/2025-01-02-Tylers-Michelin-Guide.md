## Fine Dining And Breathing

There are a lot of hobbies that I am not very good at at first, and there are some hobbies I have put an inordinate amount of time and am still not good at (wanna play chess?). However, there is one hobby that I've been good at since birth: eating. I love trying new restaurants, and as I have traveled more I have begun to prioritize seeking out fun new dining experiences.
