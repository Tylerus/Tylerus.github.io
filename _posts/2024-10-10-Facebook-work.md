## What I do all day at Meta

In may 2022 I was hired to work at Meta, formerly Facebook. I am currently a software engineer, based in Seattle Washington. I'm currently employed here, working in the domain of signal loss. Most of my work involves ad privacy, i.e. working to comply with current and future privacy-protecting regulations that affect what Meta reports to advertisers.
