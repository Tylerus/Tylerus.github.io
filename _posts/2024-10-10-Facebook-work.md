## What I do all day at Meta

In May 2022 I was hired to work at Meta, n√©e Facebook. I am currently a software engineer, based in Seattle Washington, working in the domain of signal growth. Most of my work involves ad privacy, i.e. working to comply with current and future privacy-protecting regulations that affect what Meta reports to advertisers. In particular, I am on one of the teams responsible for modeling missing or partial advertising conversions.

In my 3-ish years at Meta, I've worked with some brilliant people on some unbelievably cool projects. One of the biggest draws to working at a place like this is the scale - problems that are being worked on are affect billions of people.
