## What I do all day at Meta

In may 2022 I was hired to work at Meta, n√©e Facebook. I am currently a software engineer, based in Seattle Washington, working in the domain of signal growth. Most of my work involves ad privacy, i.e. working to comply with current and future privacy-protecting regulations that affect what Meta reports to advertisers. In particular, I am on one of the teams responsible for modelling missing or partial advertising conversions.
